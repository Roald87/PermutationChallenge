# PermutationChallenge
Trying to make the same code in *n* different ways.

## Idea
[Tom](https://github.com/TomNij) and [Roald](https://github.com/Roald87) will take turns in making a method which does the same thing in different ways.

## Notes
Based on an idea from [vihart](https://github.com/vihart/fiftyfizzbuzzes/blob/master/Fifty%20Fizzbuzzes.ipynb).
